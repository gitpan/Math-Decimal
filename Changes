version 0.001; 2009-05-14

  * bugfix: division/rounding misparsed inputs with magnitude less than
    one and so gave grossly incorrect results

  * don't bother with variant input forms in t/rndiv.t, where both
    implementations cleanly canonicalise all inputs

version 0.000; 2009-05-13

  * initial released version
