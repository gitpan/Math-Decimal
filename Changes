version 0.003; 2011-09-14

  * bugfix: in XS version of dec_sub(), correct the special-case handling
    of subtraction from zero, which was giving output with the wrong sign

  * change usage of Params::Classify functions to take advantage of
    custom ops in Params::Classify 0.012

  * in XS, use newSVpvs() wherever appropriate

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * in t/setup_pp.pl, avoid a warning that occurs if XSLoader::load()
    is given no arguments, which is now a valid usage

  * jump through hoops to avoid compiler warnings

  * correct dynamic_config setting to 0

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.002; 2010-08-20

  * in dec_cmp and dec_sgn, return strings that have been numerified,
    to work around perl bug #69384 (affecting Perls prior to 5.11.0)
    where unnumerified strings are rejected by the sort operator

  * port to Perl 5.11, supporting new first-class regexp objects in
    type checking

  * in documentation, correct summary of dec_cmp's parameters

  * in documentation, more consistent italicisation of parameter names

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * also test POD coverage of pure Perl implementation

  * make XS code const clean for gcc -Wwrite-strings

  * in Build.PL, explicitly set needs_compiler to avoid bogus
    auto-dependency on ExtUtils::CBuilder

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.001; 2009-05-14

  * bugfix: division/rounding misparsed inputs with magnitude less than
    one and so gave grossly incorrect results

  * don't bother with variant input forms in t/rndiv.t, where both
    implementations cleanly canonicalise all inputs

version 0.000; 2009-05-13

  * initial released version
